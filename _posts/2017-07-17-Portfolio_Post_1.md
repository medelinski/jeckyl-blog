Over my years at conestoga I have learned many things. I have learned computer programming, web developing/design & app development. The computer languages that I am proficient in are C#,Java,HTML,CSS,SQL,PHP  & Javascript.Sometimes I like to do my own app developing projects outside of school or make website for people.
